#Problem/Purpose: Ask for the number of roads surveyed and,
#for each road, the number of days that the counters were installed.
#It should calculate and output the average number of vehicles
#traveled down each road per day as well as the total number of vehicles
#and the average number of vehicles for all of the roads.


#The inputs of this program are: Numbers of roads surveyed.
#How long to roads were suveryed.

#The outputs of this program are: Idividual road averages.
#Total number of cars per road.
#Average cars per road.

#Certification of Authenticity:
#I certify that this lab is entirely my own work.

#Naming program call.
