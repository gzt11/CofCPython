#Purpose: The purpose of this program is to calculate a the mean, RMS, and standard deviation.

#Inputs: Number of numbers to be entered. Number entered.
#Outputs: Mean, RMS, Standard deviation calculations.

#For this program to work:
#To find mean add numbers / numOfNumbers
#To find the RMS average there's 4 steps.
#1. List your range of numbers
#2. square each number you input
#3.Take the number of numbers you inputed (Ex:4)
#4.Divide that number by the number of numbers.
#5. This should give you the root-mean-average.
#Visualized example: 10**2+5**2+2**2+5**2
#100+25+4+25 = 154 = 154/4 = 38.5**0.5 = 6.2048368229954285
