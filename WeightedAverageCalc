##Purpose: Take input from text file with grades and weights, average,
##and place in an organized text file.
##Instruction Scenario:
##A professor at Hardtack University has an unusual method of grading.
##The students may or may not all take the same number of tests.
##The individual tests are weighted, and these weights are used to compute
##the student's average.
##Important: the weights for all of the tests for a given student must add to 100. Assuming that w1 ... wn are the weights, and g1 ... gn are the grades, the average is computed by the formula:

##Input:
##Text file: grades.txt.
##Input algorithm to find average:
##((w1 * g1) + (w2 * g2) + ... + (wn * gn)) / 100


##Output: In text file FirstnameLastnameAve.txt
##Example:
##Billy Bother's average: 87.0
#Oh No’s average: Error: The weights are less than 100.
#Hermione Heffalump's average: 95.4
#Too Bad’s average: Error: The weights are more than 100.
#Kurt Kidd's average: 82.5
#Class average: 88.3

#Certification of Authenticity:
#I certify that this lab is entirely my own work.




#Program weighted Average(inFileName, outFileName).

    #Read input file line by line.
    readInFileName = inputFileName.read()
    #print(readInFileName)
    
    #Split read file on the line break character.
